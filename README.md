🌟 Welcome to My Enchanted Homework 1 Project! 🌟

WEBSITE: https://youneslamcherradi.github.io/

In this mystical assignment, I've woven spells with HTML and CSS to craft a visually captivating website, while invoking the dynamic powers of Flask as the sorcerer behind the scenes.

At first, I unleashed the magic of GitHub Pages to host my wondrous creation, where it shimmered like a celestial gem in the digital cosmos. But behold! There's more to this tale!

With the wizardry of Visual Studio, I summoned Flask to breathe life into the project, infusing it with potent functionality. 🧙‍♂️ Through Flask, I conjured countless routes, weaving a tapestry of interactivity using diverse techniques such as directory templates and static file sorcery. Thus, the website became a realm of endless possibilities, beckoning visitors to embark on a magical journey.

Yet, the enchantment did not stop there! In my pursuit of perfection, I ventured deep into the mystical arts of CSS. I wielded techniques like hover transitions and many more, imbuing every pixel with an aura of elegance and charm. Each hover, each click, became a dance of whimsy and wonder, inviting users to explore further.

To unite our forces and forge a stronghold of collaboration, I ventured forth and uploaded both the website's configuration and the Flask spellbook to the sacred repository within Itmo-WAD. Behold! A sanctuary where ideas converge, and dreams take flight.

But how did I achieve such feats? Fear not, for I wielded the mighty Git with finesse! With but a flick of my command wand, I initialized, added, committed, and pushed my creation to the heavens of version control.

🌟🚀 Embrace the adventure that awaits within my Homework 1 project! 🚀🌟
